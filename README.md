# CIS4190Final

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Classifying animals in camera trap images using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)

This is the Github repo for the final project report of CIS 4190/5190. Please find 3 main notebooks for each of the 3 network architectures used to classify the iWildCam 2022 training images:

* AlexNet Implementation (.ipnyb)
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:
